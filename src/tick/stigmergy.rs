//! Autonomic cold-path garbage collection for the stigmergy substrate.
//!
//! Implements the loop promised in `docs/kern/stigmergy-self-improving.md`:
//! "unused pheromone evaporates → thought cools → automatic garbage collection
//! via `forget()`". This module is the `forget()` half — the heat-decay half
//! lives in `tick::pulse`.

/// Stigmergic cold-path GC for one kern.
///
/// Policy: a thought is dropped iff **all** of the following hold:
///
/// 1. `heat < COLD_HEAT_THRESHOLD` (pheromone has fully evaporated).
/// 2. `now - accessed_at > COLD_GC_AGE` (not just transiently quiet —
///    actually abandoned).
/// 3. `kind` is neither `Fact` nor `Document` (durable kinds per
///    `docs/kern/safety-architecture.md`; never auto-forgotten).
///
/// Removal goes through `base::reason::remove_entity`, which is the same
/// path used by the explicit `forget` command and which cascades edge
/// cleanup. We acquire the write guard exactly once for the whole kern —
/// no per-thought lock toggling.
///
/// Thoughts with no `accessed_at` timestamp are treated as recently created
/// (preserved); cold-but-untouched bookkeeping should not silently drop them.
