//! Kern — the knowledge and reasoning backend.
//!
//! Runs as a daemon (`kern --daemon`) and exposes its surface over MCP
//! stdio and HTTP. Core responsibilities:
//!
//! * **memory** — CRDT-replicated knowledge graph with gossip sync
//! * **retrieval** — vector + BM25 hybrid search over ingested content
//! * **llm** — provider-agnostic LLM dispatch with quantisation support
//! * **ingest** — file watcher pipeline that feeds the retrieval index
//! * **rpc** — typed MCP service layer consumed by external MCP clients
