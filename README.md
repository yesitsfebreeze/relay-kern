# kern

**A self-learning memory daemon for AI agents.** One long-running process per
working directory owns a knowledge graph that captures durable facts from your
sessions, keeps itself small without gardening, and serves the right context
back when you need it.

kern is not a vector store you bolt onto an app. It is a *memory substrate*: it
learns on its own, compacts on its own, and (optionally) federates across
machines on its own.

```
session text → spool → distill (LLM) → typed claims → graph → digest → recall
```

---

## What it does

- **Captures automatically.** A Claude Code `Stop` hook extracts the new
  conversation delta and drops it in `<cwd>/.relay/capture/`. The daemon drains
  it, runs one LLM distillation pass that pulls out durable *facts*,
  *decisions*, and *preferences* as typed claims, and ingests each into the
  graph. Nothing is lost on an LLM outage — the delta stays queued until it
  succeeds.

- **Recalls into context.** The daemon keeps a fresh **digest** (root purpose +
  hottest thoughts) at `<cwd>/.relay/kern/digest.md`. A `SessionStart` hook
  injects it into every new session. For deeper mid-session lookups the agent
  calls the `query` MCP tool directly.

- **Compacts itself.** Every access leaves a **heat** trace; heat decays on each
  tick. A stigmergy GC evicts cold, stale, non-durable thoughts (Facts are
  immune) and spills them to an append-only cold store before dropping them — so
  compaction never destroys data. Similar thoughts cluster into child kerns. The
  hot graph stays small; the long tail stays cheap.

- **Federates (opt-in).** Multiple nodes share knowledge over LAN gossip with no
  coordinator. Each node heartbeats peers and merges entity bodies via a
  content-addressed CRDT — a thought ingested on node A becomes searchable on
  node B under the same content-hash id. Off by default.

- **One graph per directory.** The daemon is per-cwd. Each project gets its own
  isolated memory; no cross-project contamination, multiple daemons per host.

## How it works

### The graph

kern stores two things:

- **Thoughts** — factual chunks and LLM-extracted claims. Typed (`normal`,
  `fact`, `document`) and weighted by confidence + heat.
- **Reasons** — justified edges between thoughts. The *why* connecting two
  facts, not just a similarity score.

Ids are **content hashes**, so identical content is the same node everywhere —
existence is a set union, which is what makes conflict-free merge across nodes
work.

### Retrieval

A query runs a hybrid pipeline, all hand-rolled, dependencies deliberately
minimal:

1. **Seed** — vector (HNSW) + lexical (BM25) candidate generation.
2. **Expand** — walk reason edges out from the seeds; optionally **HyDE** a
   hypothetical answer to broaden recall.
3. **Fuse** — reciprocal-rank fusion of the vector and lexical lists.
4. **Rerank** — a GNN layer scores relationships with learned embeddings;
   PageRank weights graph centrality.
5. **Diversify** — drop near-duplicates so the `k` results actually differ.
6. **Answer** (optional) — synthesize an LLM answer over the top results.

Cold-store results fill remaining slots (marked `cold:true`) when the hot graph
returns fewer than `k`.

### The daemon

`kern --daemon` exposes its surface two ways:

- **MCP** (stdio + HTTP/SSE) for external clients like Claude Code.
- **tarpc `KernRpc`** over a per-cwd socket for the rest of the relay stack
  (`agnt`, `repl`).

A background **tick** (default 60s) drives decay, eviction, and clustering — an
idle daemon still maintains itself. Persistence is `bincode`. HNSW, the GNN,
beam search, gossip, and the MCP server are all written from scratch.

## Using it

### Quickstart

**Prerequisites:** a Rust toolchain, Node.js (for the hooks), and a local
[Ollama](https://ollama.com) with the default models pulled:

```bash
ollama pull bge-m3      # embeddings (default)
ollama pull qwen2.5     # distillation / reasoning (default)
```

**1. Build the binary.**

```bash
cargo build --release   # produces target/release/kern
```

**2. Register the MCP server with Claude Code.** `kern mcp` attaches to a
running daemon if one exists, and otherwise auto-spawns a detached daemon for
the current directory — so this one command is all you need to bring kern up:

```bash
claude mcp add kern -- /abs/path/to/kern/target/release/kern mcp
```

**3. Install the capture + recall hooks** once in `~/.claude/settings.json`.
The scripts ship in [`hooks/`](hooks/) — see [`hooks/README.md`](hooks/README.md)
for the exact settings block. They are guarded to no-op outside `.relay/`
projects, so a single global registration is safe everywhere.

**4. Seed the graph** (see *Seed the graph* below), then start a session. From
then on, capture and recall are automatic.

Verify the daemon is alive at any point with `kern health`.

### Configure

Everything lives in `<cwd>/.relay/kern.toml`:

```toml
[reason]
# LLM for distillation. Local Ollama.
url = "http://localhost:11434"
model = "qwen2.5"           # default

[embed]
# Embedding model. Local Ollama.
url = "http://localhost:11434"
model = "bge-m3"            # default; dimension inferred at runtime

[capture]
enabled = true          # self-learning

[tick]
interval_secs = 60      # self-compaction cadence (0 = event-driven only)

[gossip]
enabled = false         # self-distribution (opt-in)
addr = "0.0.0.0:7400"
discovery = true
discovery_port = 7475
peers = []
```

> [`docs/FEDERATION-SECURITY.md`](docs/FEDERATION-SECURITY.md). Federation is
> unauthenticated and unencrypted today — enable it only on a network segment
> where you trust every host.

### Hooks

The two Claude Code hooks live in [`hooks/`](hooks/): `kern-capture.mjs`
(`Stop` → capture) and `kern-recall.mjs` (`SessionStart` → recall). Register
them once in `~/.claude/settings.json` — full instructions and the exact JSON
block are in [`hooks/README.md`](hooks/README.md). They are guarded: they no-op
in any directory without a `.relay/` folder, so one global registration is safe
across every project. Both fail open — if the daemon or its LLM is down, the
session proceeds and capture simply queues.

### Seed the graph

Once, via MCP: set the root `purpose` and add typed descriptors (`preference`,
`decision`, `project`, `fact`, `code-fact`, `reference`).

### MCP tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `query` | Search the graph. Scored thoughts + optional LLM answer. Filter by `mode`, `kind`, `source`, time range, `min_conf`. |
| `ingest` | Add text. Supports `object_id` update semantics and `descriptor` chunking context. |
| `link` | Create a reason edge between two thoughts (LLM writes the reason if blank). |
| `forget` | Remove a thought and cascade its edges. Facts are immune. |
| `degrade` | Down-weight the edges along a bad retrieval path — teaches the graph from miss feedback. |
| `purpose` | Set or read the root purpose. |
| `descriptor` | Add/remove a data-type descriptor. |
| `health` | Graph stats: thought/edge counts, tick heat. |
| `pulse` | Trigger a clustering pass across the kern tree. |

## kern vs. traditional RAG

Traditional RAG is a pipeline you operate: chunk documents, embed them, stuff a
vector DB, and on every query do top-k cosine + prompt-stuff. kern is a memory
that operates itself.

| | Traditional RAG | kern |
|---|---|---|
| **Ingestion** | Manual: you run a chunk-and-embed job over a corpus. | Automatic: sessions distill into typed claims via a Stop hook. |
| **Unit stored** | Raw text chunks. | Distilled facts/decisions/preferences + *reason edges* between them. |
| **Retrieval** | top-k vector similarity. | Hybrid vector + BM25, edge expansion, RRF fusion, GNN + PageRank rerank, diversify. |
| **Structure** | A flat bag of vectors. | A knowledge graph — recall can follow *why* one fact connects to another. |
| **Growth** | Index grows unbounded; you re-index and prune by hand. | Self-compacting: heat decay + stigmergy GC + clustering keep the hot graph small; cold tier preserves the tail. |
| **Staleness** | Stale chunks linger until you rebuild. | Cold, non-durable thoughts decay and evict on their own; Facts persist. |
| **Feedback** | None — a bad chunk keeps ranking. | `degrade` down-weights bad retrieval paths; access heat re-ranks what you actually use. |
| **Conflicts / sync** | Single store; multi-node needs external infra. | Content-addressed CRDT + gossip; nodes converge with no coordinator. |
| **Scope** | One global index. | One graph per working directory. |

The short version: RAG gives you **search over a corpus you maintain**. kern
gives you **memory that maintains itself** — it decides what is durable, forgets
what isn't, and connects facts with reasons instead of leaving you a flat list
of nearest neighbors.

## Status

Self-learning and self-compaction run today. Self-distribution is wired,
enableable, and verified content-level on a single host (scope + entity bodies
propagate bidirectionally). Federation tuning at scale (batch size, push vs.
pull, anti-entropy) is open, but the convergence path is proven. Version stays
`1.0.0`.
